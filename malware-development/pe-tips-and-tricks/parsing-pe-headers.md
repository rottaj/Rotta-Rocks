# Parsing PE Headers

## PE Structure

Every header shown is a data structure that holds information about the PE file.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)



### Relative Virtual Addresses (RVAs)

Relative Virtual Addresses are addresses used to reference locations within a PE file. For example, specifying the location of code, data, and resources.

_<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT:**</mark>_ An RVA is a 32-bit value that specifies the **offset** of a data structure or section from the beginning of the PE file. Hence relative because it specifies the offset from the beginning of the file, rather than an absolute memory address.

The PE header contains several RVAs that specify the location of the code and data sections, the _**import**_ and _**export**_ tables, and other important data structures.

### DOS Header (IMAGE\_DOS\_HEADER)

The DOS header is located at the beginning of the PE file and contains information about the file, such as its size, and characteristics. _**But most importantly, it contains the RVA (offset) to the NT header.**_

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Retrieve DOS Header (IMAGE\_DOS\_HEADER):**</mark>_

```c
// Pointer to the structure 
PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER pImgDosHdr = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)pPE;		
if (pImgDosHdr->e_magic != IMAGE_DOS_SIGNATURE){
	return -1;
}
```

_<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE:**</mark>_ Since the DOS header is at the very beginning of a PE file, retrieving the value is only a matter of getting a pointer. (pPE).

### NT Header (IMAGE\_NT\_HEADER)

The `e_lfanew` member of the DOS header is an RVA to the `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` structure.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Retrieve NT Header (IMAGE\_NT\_HEADER):**</mark>_

```c
// Pointer to the structure
PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS pImgNtHdrs = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)(pPE + pImgDosHdr->e_lfanew);
if (pImgNtHdrs->Signature != IMAGE_NT_SIGNATURE) {
	return -1;
}
```

### File Header (IMAGE\_FILE\_HEADER)

Since the file header is a member of the `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` structure, it can be accessed using the following line of code.

```c
IMAGE_FILE_HEADER		ImgFileHdr	= pImgNtHdrs->FileHeader;
```

### Optional Header (IMAGE\_OPTIONAL\_HEADER)

Since the optional header is a member of the `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` structure, it is can be accessed using the following code.

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Retrieve Optional Header (IMAGE\_OPTIONAL\_HEADER):**</mark>_

```c
IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER	ImgOptHdr = pImgNtHdrs->OptionalHeader;
if (ImgOptHdr.Magic != IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR_MAGIC) {
	return -1;
}
```

_<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE:**</mark>_ Depending on the compiler architecture, the `IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR_MAGIC` constant will automatically expand to the correct value:

* `IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR32_MAGIC` - 32-bit
* `IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR64_MAGIC` - 64-bit

### DataDirectory (IMAGE\_DATA\_DIRECTORY)

The Data Directory can be accessed from the optional's header last member. This is an array of `IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY` meaning each element in the array is an `IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY` structure that references a special data directory. The `IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY` structure is shown below.

```c
typedef struct _IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY {
    DWORD   VirtualAddress;
    DWORD   Size;
} IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY;
```

The fields of the structure contain information such as:

* `VirtualAddress` - Specifies the virtual address of the specified structure in the PE file, these are `RVAs`.
* `Size` - Specifies the size of the data directory.

### Export Table (IMAGE\_EXPORT\_DIRECTORY)

This structure is not officially documented by Microsoft. You will need to use unofficial documentation.\


**Export Table Structure**

The export table is a structure defined as `IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` which is shown below.

```c
typedef struct _IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY {
    DWORD   Characteristics;
    DWORD   TimeDateStamp;
    WORD    MajorVersion;
    WORD    MinorVersion;
    DWORD   Name;
    DWORD   Base;
    DWORD   NumberOfFunctions;
    DWORD   NumberOfNames;
    DWORD   AddressOfFunctions;     // RVA from base of image
    DWORD   AddressOfNames;         // RVA from base of image
    DWORD   AddressOfNameOrdinals;  // RVA from base of image
} IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY;
```

**Retrieving The Export Table**

The `IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` structure is used to store information about the functions and data that are exported from a PE file. This information is stored in the data directory array with the index `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT`. To fetch it from the `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER` structure:

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Retrieve Export Table:**</mark>_

```c
PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY pImgExportDir = (PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY)(pPE + ImgOptHdr.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT].VirtualAddress);
```

### Import Table (IMAGE\_IMPORT\_DIRECTORY)

The import address table is an array of `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` structures with each one being for a DLL file that contains the functions that were used from these DLLs.

**Import Address Table Structure**

The `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` structure is also not officially documented by Microsoft although it is defined in the [Winnt.h Header File](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/) as follows:

```c
typedef struct _IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR {
    union {
        DWORD   Characteristics;
        DWORD   OriginalFirstThunk;
    } DUMMYUNIONNAME;
    DWORD   TimeDateStamp;
    DWORD   ForwarderChain;
    DWORD   Name;
    DWORD   FirstThunk;
} IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR;
```

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Retrieving The Import Address Table**</mark>_

```c
IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR* pImgImpDesc = (PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR)(pPE + ImgOptHdr.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT].VirtualAddress);
```
