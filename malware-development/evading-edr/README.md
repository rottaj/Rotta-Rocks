Here are some fantastic articles that I've discovered throughout my research into EDR's.

## The EDR Process

EDR's work by utilizing kernel callbacks to inject Hooks into newly created processes. Here's how it works:&#x20;

To determine what the file is about to execute as a process, the antimalware engine scans the file’s content at the time of process creation through a process creation callback. Antimalware engines also scan freshly edited files once a handle to that file has been closed.
