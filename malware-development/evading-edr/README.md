# Evading EDR

Here are some fantastic articles that I've discovered throughout my research into EDR's.

## The EDR Process

EDR's work by utilizing kernel callbacks to inject Hooks into newly created processes. Here's how it works:&#x20;

To determine what the file is about to execute as a process, the antimalware engine scans the file’s content at the time of process creation through a process creation callback. Antimalware engines also scan freshly edited files once a handle to that file has been closed.



## Kernel Callback Functions

Callbacks, in simple terms, is just a function that isn't directly invoked by the developer. Instead, it is invoked when a specific event occurs. Some events for Kernel Callbacks are:

Process / thread creation, obtaining a handle, setting a registry key, closing process / thread, or any other activities.

### How Kernel Callbacks are created

Kernel callbacks in Windows involves developing kernel-mode drivers. These drivers are able to register various callbacks to receive notifications or intercept events in the kernel. While it's not the on;y way to interact with kernel callbacks, developing a kernel-mode driver is a common approach.



Microsoft provides a variety of functions that allow callbacks to be registered and intercept events in the kernel.

On Process Creation

Process creation notification isn’t invoked right when a process creation API is called, but rather when the first thread is inserted into a process.
