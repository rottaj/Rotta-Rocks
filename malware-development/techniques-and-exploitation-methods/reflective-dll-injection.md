# Reflective DLL Injection

{% embed url="https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/" %}

_<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE:**</mark>_ Most EDR's have updated their capabilities to detect this default process injection technique utilized by Stephen Fewer along with his Remote Process Execution technique using the CreateRemoteThread API.

EDR's also scan newly created Executable memory blocks in remote processes that have PAGE\_EXECUTE\_READWRITE permissions. A way around this is to parse the PE headers and distribute the sections of PE to different locations. So unlike, Stephen Fewer's default reflective loader that allocates the whole memory block to a single page with VirtualAllocEx, we will have separate sections that have different permissions.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE:**</mark>_ Also, it's important to note that changing Stephen Fewer's default reflective loader page permissions to PAGE\_EXECUTE\_READ to try to evade EDR will end in an ACCESS\_VIOLATION error. This is because there are several different sections in the PE that have their own permissions (which we cover above).\\
