# SSH Private Keys

Often times we'll need to pass in a passphrase along with the SSH private key to gain access to the host via ssh. We can use the private key to try and crack the password.

## Cracking with Hashcat

### Change Permissions of id\_rsa

Chances are we've downloaded a id\_rsa file with read only permissions. To convert to a hash we'll need to update this.

```shell-session
kali@kali$ chmod 600 id_rsa
```

### Convert with ssh2john

```shell-session
kali@kali$ ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
```

### Format Hash File

We'll need to fix the hash file output from the JtR suite. Removing the filename before the hash.

We remote **id\_rsa:**

```
id_rsa:$sshng$6$16$705
```

```
$sshng$6$16$705...
```

### Searching For Hash

We can use Hashcat to search for the Hash. We see that it is SHA-512 **22921**

### Running Hashcat

```
└─$ hashcat -m 22921 id_rsa.hash passwords.txt

  This error happens if the wrong hash type is specified, if the hashes are
  malformed, or if input is otherwise not as expected (for example, if the
  --username option is used but no username is present)

```

#### <mark style="color:red;">If we get No hashes loaded error we'll need to use another tool.</mark>

This is because modern SSH Private keys use AES-256, which Hashcat does not support.



## Cracking with John

<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE:**</mark> It's important that the wordlist is the first parameter and hash is the second. Don't ask why.

### Creating Rules in John

To add rules to John we need to add them to the **/etc/john/john.conf** fil&#x65;**. View "Identifying & Building Rules".**

```shell-session
kali@kali$ cat ssh.rule
[List.Rules:sshRules]
c $1 $3 $7 $!
c $1 $3 $7 $@
c $1 $3 $7 $#

kali@kali$ sudo sh -c 'cat rules.txt >> /etc/john/john.conf'
```
